Few weeks ago i've finished 75 hours data science course and chose this idea as my graduation project. I was fascinated about idea that with a little bit of data analysis/preparation and few machine learning algorithms, computer can read text information and decide which part of it is funny and which is serious. This is my first full project so you can except some slightly terrible and innefective ideas. Everyone should start somwhere and i hope that with every new project i'll get better and better. And now without further ado let's go straight to the point'
